# App Interview Project

This is an example project we use for all app developer interview candidates. It is designed to look and feel like a real application so that we can better guage how you will operate in a project with our clients.

Thank you for taking the time to work on the project and interview with us. We appreciate your time.

## Grading Criteria

One thing we dislike about many interview processes is a lack of transparency to how a person is being graded. Below is our grading criteria for the assignment. This also mirrors many of the exact skills we need the ideal person to have.

- Fullstack Skillset. You will be asked to add/fix code related to the entire software stack. This means some frontend UI, some API intergration, some backend, and some database. We don't need you to be an expert at all, but you must handle all for this job.

2. Client Business/Requirements. How well are you able to understand the client business and adapt/suggest solutions that fit them specifically? Every client project we have is unique, you will need to be able to quickly grasp concepts from the client's business 
3. Feature Work. Can you perform routine feature work development for the project as if the client was asking for them. We will assign a few small improvements to the code. You will be asked to complete these as part of the assignment.
4. Bug Fixes. How well can you identify and fix bugs the client finds during testing? All of our projects are developed in realtime with the client. You will be receiving feedback and need to tweak things nearly every week of the project.
5. Testing. You will be asked do write a few tests for your code. Automated tests are the backbone of confidence shipping products to clients and customers.
6. Effectiveness vs Perfection. We routinely need to sacrifice ideal code in favor of effective code that gets the job done now. This means we often take on technical debt and document what needs improved later.
